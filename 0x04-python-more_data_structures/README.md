### Description
Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
#### What I should learn from the project:
- What are set and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate into a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What is map, reduce and map functions

### Requirements:
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files to be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- Style: PEP 8 style (version 1.7)

-----|------------
0-square\_matrix\_simple.py | A function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix and returns a new matrix. Not allowed to import any module. 
1-search\_replace.py | A function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list. Not allowed to import any module.
2-uniq\_add.py | A function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer). Not allowed to import any module.
3-common\_elements.py | A function that returns a set of common element in two sets. Now allowed to import any module.
4-only\_diff\_elements.py | A function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set. Not allowed to import any module.
5-number\_keys.py | A function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary. Not allowed to import any module.
6-print\_sorted\_dictionary.py | A function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys. Assumes that all keys are strings. Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order. Only short keys of the first level. Dictionary values can have any type. Not allowed to import any module.
7-update\_dictionary.py | A function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary. If a key exists in a dictionary, the value will be replaced. If a key doesn't exist in a dictionary, it will be created. Not allowed to import any module.
8-simple\_delete.py | A function that deletes a key in a dictionary. If a key doesn't exist, the dictionary won't change. Now allowed to import any module.
9-multiply\_by\_2.py | A function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2. Assumes that all values are only integers. Returns a new dictionary. Now allowed to import any module.
10-best\_score.py | A function that returns a key with the biggest integers value. Assumes that all values are only integers. If no score found, return `None`. Assumes that all scores are different. Not allowed to import any module.
11-mutiply\_list\_map.py | A function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops. Returns a new list. Initial list should not be modified. Use `map`. 
12-roman\_to\_int.py | **Technical interview prep** - A function that converts a Roman numberal to an integer. Assumes the number will be between 1 to 3999. Returns an integer.
