### Description
Python - Inheritance
#### What I should learn:
- What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherit from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and `super` built-in functions

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- Style: `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.)
- All test files are executed using the command `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
